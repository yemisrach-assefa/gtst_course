## Day1 introduction to ethical hacking
# Git and Github ##
* Git is a version control system 
* github is a website where all our works are hosted
## Introduction to hacking ##
Hacking is the activity of identifying weaknesses (valunerblity)in a computer system or a network to exploit the security to gain access to personal data or business data.
There are 3 types of hackers
1. blackhat hacker: the bad guys
2. whitehat hacker:the good ones(Ethical ones)
3. greyhat hacker: middle ground between the two
The 3 core things of hacking is CIA
# confidentaility: data is confidential to all execpt to the authorized user
# Integrity:the data should be remain identical always
# Availablity:The data always should be there when ever we want to find it

## pentration testing
* Is also known as pen testing
* To check for exploitable vulnerabilities.
# pentration Testing stages
* Roconnaissance(planning)
* Scanning
* Gaining Access
* Maintaining Acess
* Clearing Tracks(logs)
Types of pentesting
* Blackbox Pentesting: Testing a system with out a prior knowldge
                       * the tester is not granted any access to the applications or networks. The tester must perform reconnaissance to obtain the sensitive knowledge needed to proceed. 
* whitebox pentesting:moslty used by 
                        * allows the tester to have complete open access to all applications and systems. The tester is granted high-level privileges access to the network and can view source code.
* greybox pentesting: is an application security testing technique that mixes white box and black box testing
                      * the tester is granted some internal access and knowledge that may come in the form of lower-level credentials, application logic flow charts, or network infrastructure maps
